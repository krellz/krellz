Hi, i'm  Miguel aka 'krellz' on gaming platforms!

I'm a Psychomotor Therapist that always loved computers, gaming and all things related to that.

In September 2023, i decided to combine my work as a therapist with developing my programming skills, so i joined university again to start studying Computer Engineering (just finished 1st year!).

In this first year i learned C language and tried to learn JavaScript by myself. Looking forward to learn more about Data Bases (i think that im gonna love that).

That's it for now!
